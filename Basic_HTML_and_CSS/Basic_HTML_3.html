            <h1> One reason why dogs prove popular is that they train easier compared to cats. Dogs can be taught tricks, manners, behaviors, and commands. You can do this for protection and safety, obedience, and even simple amusement. Dogs actually love training because they love having tasks and being part of a pack.</h1>
            <h2>There’s a reason dogs are called man’s best friend. They’ll tilt their heads, trying to understand every one of your words while trying to make you feel better when you’re sad. Cats are just going to ignore you and nap some more. Dogs are such social creatures that their relaxed owners tend to have lower blood pressure and longer lifespans, even when living alone, as compared to those who don’t own any pets at all.</h2>
