            <div class="column"> Hood River is known as the windsurfing capital of the world. But you don’t have ride the winds to appreciate this pretty city. Situated at the panoramic crossroads of the Columbia River Gorge and the Cascade Range, Hood River is the go-to destination for foodies, trekkers, historians and, yes, adrenaline junkies. It’s chock-full of scenic hiking and mountain bike trails; craft breweries, wineries and farm-to-table dining; fruit trees and lavender farms; children’s playgrounds and late-night fun for adults. And it also happens to be a great place to park your skis, with Mt. Hood’s snowy slopes an easy drive away.</div>
            <div class="column"> The wind blows steady and strong on the Columbia River — making Hood River an ideal place for water sports. Take your pick from windsurfing, kiteboarding or sailing on the mighty Columbia. Rentals and lessons are available near the marina at Big Winds Hood River, Gorge Surf Shop and Hood River WaterPlay. If you’re feeling more zen, rent a kayak or stand-up paddleboard (SUP) and find some flat water along the beach; Big Winds even offers SUP yoga classes. There’s no shortage of hiking trails in the Gorge, and the Hood River area is no exception. </div>

            <p><strong>Summer:</strong> This is prime time for the area, when average daytime highs hover in the low eighties, meaning you can wear nothing but swim trunks or a bathing suit while windsurfing or paddleboarding. Mount Hood, meanwhile, typically thaws out by early August, opening up a wealth of high-alpine backpacking and mountain-biking trails. That said, you’ll still find plenty of snow atop Palmer Glacier at Timberline Lodge—one of North America’s only year-round ski areas. The rub, of course, is that everyone else is out there with you. Expect heavy traffic en route to and around the mountain. </p>
            <p><strong>Fall: </strong>There’s a sweet spot in September when the crowds thin and before the weather turns. Expect temperatures ranging from the forties at night up to the seventies during the day. A major bonus is the Hood River Fruit Loop, a 35-mile scenic drive through farmland and forests when produce is at its ripest, with endless acres of apple orchards containing heirloom varieties from Arkansas Black to Northern Spy.</p>
            <p><strong>Winter:</strong>In-the-know powder hounds use Hood River as their home base between December and March. Typically, there’s minimal traffic on the way up to the mountain on bucolic Route 35 coming from Hood River, especially compared to the daily jam that clogs Highway 26, which runs directly from Portland to Mount Hood. Regardless of the weather, always bring chains in the winter if you don’t have snow tires. </p>
            <p><strong>Spring:</strong>Even if it’s pouring in Portland on a spring day, it’s likely you’ll find reliable sunshine in Hood River and eastward, thanks to Mount Hood’s rain-shadow effect: prevailing winds rise, cool, and condense in the form of rain (or snow) on one side of the mountain, leaving dry, warm air on the opposite side. March through May is peak wildflower season in the gorge, and the 3.5-mile Mosier Plateau, four-mile Dalles Mountain Ranch, and five-mile Lyle Cherry Orchard Trails all put on stunning displays of lupine, paintbrush, and phlox, just to name a few.</p>
